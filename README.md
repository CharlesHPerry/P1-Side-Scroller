# P1-Side-Scroller
Side scrolling platformer where you are a cute little ghost person searching for your cute ghost love, but to find them you must traverse a hostle 2D envoroment.
## Main goals
- Create a side scrolling platformer where the player has the ability to jump to reach higher platforms, avoid "enemies" and clear gaps in platforms.
- Have two end game states, one of "Win" and "Lose" the win condition will be met when the player character collides with the "Love Interest" character. The "Lose" condiction will be met when the player character collides with an "enemy" that is blocking the path to the "Love Interest"
- The game should have the allusion of gravity, I plan to have the game check if the player is colliding with a platform, and if not, have the player y cordinates decrement. "jumping" should pause the "gravity" for a short time and at the same time should increment the players y cordinate by a set ammount.
## Strech Goals
- have the enemies move back and forth
- impliment "spike traps" that if the player touches it will end the game too
- impliment a key that needs to be collected to be able to unlock a cage that the "Love Intrest" is in so you can win.
